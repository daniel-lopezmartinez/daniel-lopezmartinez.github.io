[Buy For Me](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-shopping-app-buy-for-me-brands) is an agentic shopping system that enables customers to complete purchases on third-party websites through a web-browser automation model. Unlike traditional chatbots, the system uses multimodal perception—DOM parsing, text understanding, and visual interpretation—to navigate real webpages, extract product information, make decisions, and take actions on behalf of the user.
