Foresight was a population health management initiative developed within _Google Care Studio_, focused on enabling proactive care by helping provider organizations identify and manage high-risk patients before avoidable hospitalizations occur.

The project targeted population health teams at risk-bearing provider organizations, addressing a core challenge in value-based care: while large volumes of clinical data are available, teams often lack actionable, trustworthy tools to determine which patients to prioritize, why they are high risk, and whether interventions are actually effective.
