[Project Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Nightingale) was a large-scale collaboration between [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and [Ascension](https://about.ascension.org/), one of the largest healthcare systems in the United States, focused on modernizing how clinical data is stored, accessed, and analyzed.

The project centered on building secure, scalable infrastructure for processing population-scale electronic health record (EHR) data, enabling unified access to heterogeneous clinical information such as diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, clinical notes, and longitudinal encounter histories. This work laid the foundation for advanced analytics, search, and machine-learning–enabled clinical tools.

My work on Project Nightingale focused on the data engineering and applied ML foundations required to make complex, real-world healthcare data usable at scale, including transforming fragmented EHR data into standardized, queryable representations suitable for downstream analysis and modeling.
