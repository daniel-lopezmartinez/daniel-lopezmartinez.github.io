MAIC was an early-stage startup I co-founded during my PhD, formed through the [Antler accelerator](https://www.antler.co/) and incorporated and based in Singapore. The company built an AI-enabled workforce and task management platform leveraging computer vision and real-time sensing to improve productivity, safety, and coordination in construction environments characterized by highly manual, fragmented, and data-poor workflows.

MAIC was founded as part of [Antler’s Singapore program](https://www.antler.co/residency/singapore) in mid-2019 and successfully received pre-seed investment ($100k) from Antler following an internal investment committee review. The company operated from July 2019 to July 2020 and ceased operations following the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, which significantly disrupted construction activity and pilot deployments.
