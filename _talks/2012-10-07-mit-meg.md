I delivered an oral presentation at the [Magnetoencephalography Laboratory](https://meglab.mit.edu/) of the [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/) at MIT, summarizing the results of my research internship under the supervision of [Dr Dimitrios Pantazis](https://meglab.mit.edu/dimitrios-pantazis/). The project focused on developing machine learning methods to process magnetoencephalography data and on understanding how the human brain binds visual and auditory information into a unified percept as part of a National Science Foundation supported effort.

During the internship, I designed and implemented a processing pipeline for magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to study multisensory integration and its temporal dynamics. This work involved preprocessing MEG recordings, extracting time resolved spatial patterns, and applying a variety of machine learning techniques to identify brain signals associated with the alignment, conflict or separation of visual and auditory stimuli. I focused on how temporal shifts between sensory channels affect the neural signatures of binding, and how alterations in timing can disrupt the integration process.

In the presentation, I discussed the architecture of the MEG analysis pipeline, results from multivariate classification experiments, and the early patterns we observed in response to temporally congruent versus incongruent audiovisual stimuli. I also described how these findings relate to broader questions about temporal processing, cortical organization and the computational principles underlying multisensory perception.
