I delivered an oral presentation at the [International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2018)](https://iapr.org/archives/icpr2018/index.php.html) in Beijing, China, presenting our work on personalized pain detection using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain signals. The paper received the **Best Student Paper Award**.

Our study introduced a multi-task machine learning approach for detecting experimentally induced pain from hemodynamic responses measured with fNIRS. Traditional approaches to pain recognition often struggle with significant inter-subject variability—an inherent challenge when modeling a subjective phenomenon such as pain. To address this, we formulated pain detection as a multi-task learning problem, grouping participants into latent profiles based on spectral clustering and training related models jointly.

The method combined multi-task learning with multiple kernel learning, allowing the algorithm to automatically estimate the relevance of each fNIRS channel and adapt the classifier to subject-specific response patterns. As detailed in the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8545823), this framework improved the interpretability of the resulting models—highlighting, for instance, the increased importance of anterior prefrontal cortex channels—and substantially enhanced detection performance compared to single-task baselines.

This work demonstrated the feasibility of deriving personalized, brain-based biomarkers of pain using fNIRS and machine learning, with potential applications in clinical contexts where traditional self-report may be unreliable or unavailable.
