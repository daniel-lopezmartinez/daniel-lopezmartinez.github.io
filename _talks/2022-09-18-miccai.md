I presented our work at the [Applications of Medical AI (AMAI) Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/amai2022/) at [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/), where our paper received the **Best Paper Award**. This work introduces a dynamic prediction model capable of identifying chronic kidney disease patients at high risk of requiring renal replacement therapy up to one year in advance.

The presentation summarized a large-scale analysis of Medicare claims data and a machine learning framework designed to support early clinical intervention. The paper demonstrates that a time-bucketed linear model can achieve high sensitivity and specificity across multiple prediction horizons (30–365 days), using only routinely available administrative data. This work highlights the potential for AI-driven early risk stratification to improve dialysis access planning, reduce emergency starts, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
