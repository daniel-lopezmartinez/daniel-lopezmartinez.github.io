I was invited to participate as a panelist in the _Careers in Academia and Industry_ session at [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/default.asp). This flagship event brought together researchers, innovators, and industry leaders to discuss professional pathways, career development, and the evolving relationship between academic research and real world applications.

The panel explored contrasts between academic and industry trajectories, the skills and mindsets needed to thrive in each environment, and practical guidance for early career scientists navigating these choices. Drawing from my experience across academic research labs and large scale industry teams, I discussed the challenges and opportunities of building applied machine learning systems, the importance of translational impact, and the increasing convergence between scientific innovation and product driven healthcare technology.

The session also included an interactive networking component, giving attendees the opportunity to connect with panelists and industry partners, exchange perspectives, and explore collaborations within the MICCAI community.
