I delivered an oral presentation at the [Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017)](https://cvpr2017.thecvf.com/) Workshop on Deep Affective Learning and Context Modeling, where I presented our work on personalized estimation of self reported pain intensity from facial expressions. The project introduced a two stage machine learning framework that combines recurrent neural networks with a personalized Hidden Conditional Random Field model to estimate Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores from facial landmarks.

As described in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07154), the first stage employed a bidirectional long short term memory network to estimate frame level Prkachin and Solomon Pain Intensity (PSPI) scores from sequences of facial landmarks. These estimates were then used in a personalized sequence model by incorporating an individual facial expressiveness score that quantifies how strongly each person tends to express pain relative to their self reported ratings.

In the presentation, I described how this personalized approach improves VAS prediction by accounting for large inter subject differences in facial expressiveness. Evaluated on the [UNBC McMaster Shoulder Pain dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5771462), the method demonstrated clear advantages over non personalized baselines, particularly for individuals whose observed facial responses deviate substantially from their self reported pain levels.
