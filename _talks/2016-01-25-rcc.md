I delivered an invited talk at the _Building Bridges to Develop New Medical Technologies_ workshop hosted by the [Real Colegio Complutense at Harvard University](https://rcc.harvard.edu/). The event brought together engineering and medical researchers from Boston and Spain to foster international collaboration and cross-disciplinary innovation in biomedical science and technology.

As part of the program, I presented our work on wearable technologies for health, focusing on the use of wrist worn sensors that measure skin conductance, heart rate, heart rate variability, and temperature. These physiological signals enable continuous monitoring of stress, autonomic function, and other health related states outside traditional clinical settings. I discussed how these sensing modalities support early detection of physiological changes, improve patient management, and open new opportunities for personalized health interventions.
