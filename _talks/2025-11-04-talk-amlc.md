I gave an invited talk at the **Machine Learning for Healthcare Roundtable** during the **Amazon Machine Learning Conference 2025**, presenting our work on evaluating the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in medical product question answering.

Drawing from our ALICE evaluation framework, the talk introduced a systematic method for assessing whether LLM-generated answers about medical products adhere to FDA-approved labeling, thereby mitigating the risks of hallucinations, misinformation, and off-label promotion.
