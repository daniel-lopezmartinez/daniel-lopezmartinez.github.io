I graduated from Imperial College London with First Class Honors and the Medal for Excellence of the Faculty of Engineering in 2013. I then participated in the Bioscience Enterprise Programme at the University of Cambridge. Following this, I obtained my PhD in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After graduating, I joined Google Health as a Software Engineer, where I worked on NLP for EHR data.
