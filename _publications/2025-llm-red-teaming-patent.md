Describes systems and methods to generate synthetic prompts for red-teaming large language models (LLMs). A first ML model (e.g., a Q-learning model) learns prompt modifications that increase the probability of eliciting responses that violate constraints, while additional models score prompts and responses and generate rationales to guide subsequent prompt generation and improve evaluation coverage.
