I've spent the last few days in Seattle at Amazon’s internal Machine Learning Conference (AMLC). If last year was defined by the raw frontier of GenAI capabilities, this year the focus shifted decisively toward agents, reliability, and real-world deployment. The conversation has moved from _“Can we do X?”_ to _“How do we evaluate, govern, and safely operationalize X at scale?”_. It felt like a distinctly Amazonian event: pragmatic, execution-oriented, and full of hallway discussions about shipping real systems and delivering customer impact.

I participated in the _Machine Learning for Healthcare Roundtable_ and gave a talk on [LLM trustworthiness in medical product question answering](https://daniellopezmartinez.com/talks/2025-11-04-talk-amlc), drawing on my earlier work on [Rufus](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus). But the real highlight was learning from the impressive work happening across teams. Below are a few themes that stood out to me.
